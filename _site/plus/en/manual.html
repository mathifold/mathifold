		<div class="dissap">
		The webpage has a tree-like structure with four levels:

		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
		<li>-Topics (e.g. Geometry)</li>
		<li>-Subjects (e.g. Classical Geometry)</li>
		<li>-Chapters (e.g. Triangles)</li>
		<li>-Posts (e.g. Definition Centroid)</li>
		</ul>

		<b>Posts</b> contain small amounts of theoretical content.

In this way, all the content is open-source. GitHub also provides a suitable platform to manage the different contributions.

		Jekyll

		<div class="dissap">
		Mathifold is built by the static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. People interested in collaborating in the development of the webpage should have some knowledge of it.

	<div>
		<div class="bcgreen boxdissap">
		Navigation file
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		The Navigation file shows the tree of contents up to the first three levels: topics, subjects and chapters. It is located in <a href="https://github.com/jxm-math/beta_mathifold/blob/master/_data/nav.yml" target="_blank">/data/nav.yml</a>. Each chapter has an identifier 'ident' which is used to match the posts correctly.

		Posts
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		The posts are located in the folder <a href="https://github.com/jxm-math/beta_mathifold/tree/master/_posts" target="_blank">/_posts</a> and are  separated by language. Each post is a <b>.md (markdown)</b> file named 'yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-the-file.md'. This file has a head, like a 'data sheet', and after that the content itself. In the data sheet the following items must be filled:

		<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
		<li>-<b>title</b>: Title of the post</li>
		<li>-<b>lang</b> and <b>category</b>: both the code of the language of the post</li>
		<li>-<b>permalink</b>: code-of-the-language/ident</li>
		<li>-<b>ident</b>: an identifier that must be different for each post and that should synthesize its content. It usually starts with the type of the post.</li>
		<li>-<b>parent</b>: the identifier of the chapter to which the post belongs, according to the Navigation file.</li>
		<li>-<b>kind</b>: the code of the kind of post.</li>
		<li>-<b>mathjax</b>: 'true' or 'false' according to whether the page needs mathjax (LaTeX for HTML).</li>
		<li>-<b>layout</b> and <b>type</b>: both filled with 'post'.</li>

		<div class="dissap">
		To introduce pictures or videos, they must be located in the folder '/images/images', and if having the source code, this must be located with the same name (though different extension) in '/images/codes'. Then complete the post with the following command: <br /><br />

		

		{% resource name-of-the-file.xxx %}

		<br /><br />

		and automatically the picture or video will appear in the webpage.

    	Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. </div>

    	<a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a> is a strong bet we make in Mathifold: a powerful software for animated films and applets with high pedagogical value.

	<b>How to collaborate</b> <br /><br />

	<div>
		<div class="bcgreen boxdissap">
		Creation of posts and new materials
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		In these first stages of the project it is recommendable to <b>directly contact Mathifold's Team before creating materials</b>. <br /><br />

		For those having a clear idea of where and how to collaborate, the most appropriate way is by creating a GitHub account, <b>make a fork in repository jxm-math/beta_mathifold</b>, add here the new files and <b>send pull-requests on a periodic basis</b>. It is important for the time being <b>not to modify other files</b> since otherwise pull-requests will have a conflict with files and will not be accepted.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="bcgreen boxdissap">
		Translation
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		The webpage is multilingual and we would like to have it translated to several languages, in such a way that it can help a larger amount of people.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="bcgreen boxdissap">
		Difussion
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		Difussion in <b>social networks and educational centers</b>, in order to get more users and collaborators.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class="bcgreen boxdissap">
		Programming and Design
		</div>

		<div class="dissap">
		We are on the way to set a team of computer specialists which will improve the webpage over the time. As of now, the main challenge is to provide <b>user accounts</b> allowing each student to customize his/her own learning process.
