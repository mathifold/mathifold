        "content": "Any curious mathematician has come accross the formulaand I would bet it caused him/her both a deep shock and a terrible curiosity. As a matter of fact, such expression doesn’t fit in any way into the usual notion of convergent sum. For instance, we use to say thatsince the partial sumsget closer and closer to 2 in a way explained in detail in any Calculus course.(OK, so far it wasn’t too difficult, was it?)However, the partical sums of the natural numbers behave in quite a different wayThey grow and grow without an end in sight, so that the sum diverges. And now one comes and tells us we’re too naive and this sum is actually $-\\dfrac{1}{12}$. Amazing what a dimwit, right?Well, not so much.It’s true of course that the sum of the natural numbers diverges in the standard sense of convergence, but maybe it’s useful to look at this sum from a different angle. Let me explain this with an example.The previous sum $1+\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{8}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+\\cdots=2$ is actually just a particular case of a geometric sum: if $|x|&lt; 1$, how much is $1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\\cdots$?thus arriving to the beautiful formulaPerfect! For $x=\\dfrac{1}{2}$, we get $S=\\dfrac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}=2$.But what if $|x|$ isn’t less than 1? For instance, taking $x=2$, it turns out that $1+2+4+8+16+\\cdots=-1$. That’s awful! However, it still keeps appealing to us. A boring mathematician would say    The formula $1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\\cdots=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ only makes sense when $|x|&lt; 1$ and it shouldn't be considered outside its validity range.While a kamikaze mathematican (I sincerely hope you all are in this class!) would say:    Taking such a cool function as $\\frac{1}{1-x}$ only within $(-1,1)$ doesn't go. It's really mind-blowing saying that $1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\\cdots=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ for any $x$, no matter how shocking the conclusions are!What the kamikaze mathematician has just done is what we call an analytical continuation (the concepts kamikaze and rigorous are not opposed, but rather complement each other!).Something like this is what happens with $1+2+3+4+5+\\cdots=-\\dfrac{1}{12}$.In 1859, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann introduced the ever-ubiquitous zeta function:which, despite converging in a suitable way only for $s&gt;1$ (more precisely, for $\\text{Re}(s)&gt;1$ in the complex plane), can also be analytically continued.(Did anyone imagine it would be kindergarten stuff?)Unfortunately, in this case the process of analytical continuation is tremendously complicated… but nevertheless contains the precious gold nugget:In fact, this makes plausible our initial statement. But… may we do some trick to avoid having to do the analytical continuation of the $\\zeta$-function? Let’s see what can be done. We should proceed as in the beginning:On the other handand, evaluating at $x=-1$So we can summarize everything we have seen so far in the following accurate terms.    We don't know what the hell can mean that $1+2+3+4+5+\\cdots=-\\frac{1}{12}$, but all people willing to associate a finite sum to this series end up saying it adds up to $-\\frac{1}{12}$.And we don’t feel uncomfortable at all about this.Anyway, some boring mathematician (yes, it’s sad, they exist and are far from unique…) can tell us: ‘What’s the point in all this, if it deals with things that do not make sense’. Well, as extraordinary as it may seem, we can answer back conclusively: the expression $1+2+3+4+5+\\cdots=-\\frac{1}{12}$ has visible physical implications, for instance in areas like quantum mechanics or string theory. Specifically, we can refer to the Casimir effect and the renormalization of zero-point energy, or to the computation of the critical dimension in bosonic string theory. Of course, these phenomena are difficult to explain… but not impossible to understand. Cheer up! All the beauty in the cosmos is open to the good mathematician.",

The other functions are continuous on their domains. However, we need to check that the three functions have the same value at $x = 0$, so we have to solve the limits to the left and to the right and follow the definition of continuity. Then:$\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^+}\\dfrac{\\tan(x)}{\\sqrt{x}}$ We apply L'Hôpital's Rule (The limit is of indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$). $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^+}\\dfrac{\\tan(x)}{\\sqrt{x}} = \\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^+}\\dfrac{1 + (\\tan(x))^2}{\\frac{1}{2·\\sqrt{x}}} = \\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^+}\\dfrac{2·\\sqrt{x}·(1 + (\\tan(x))^2)}{1} = 0$ $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^-} e^{1/x} = e^{-\\infty} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\infty}} = 0$$f(0) = 0$ Finally, according to the definition of continuity, since $\\displaystyle f(0) =  \\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^+}f(x) = \\lim_{x\\longrightarrow 0^-} f(x) = 0 $, the function is continuous at $x = 0$. Therefore, the function is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ except when $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2·\\pi·k$ where $k\\in  0, 1, 2...$.",

        "content": "What is Functional Analysis about? It deals with certain strange fenomena having place when mixing infinite dimensional vector spaces with topology. Let’s examine some enlighting examples.In basic Linear Algebra it is customary to work with finite dimensional vector spaces, like $\\mathbb{R}^3$. These spaces may be given a topology, of course. But there aren’t many choices: any sensible topology in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (that is, compatible with $\\mathbb{R}$, its distance and topology) will match the usual topology, the one coming from euclidean distance, or product topology, or whatever. Linear forms (such as $(x,y,z)\\longmapsto x+2y+3z$) are always continuous and behave perfectly.We’re not used to work in infinite dimension, so we’ll take the vector space of continuous functions in $[0,1]$, which is denoted by $C[0,1]$. We may imagine lots and lots of functions            As a vector space, its structure is standard; to endorse it a topology, supreme distance is usually used: given two functions $f$ and $g$, its distance is defined asand it is easy to check that it is indeed a well-behaved distance giving a topology to $C[0,1]$. No problem so far.To move into a more exotic setting let’s consider a vector subspace, which is also a topological subspace: $P[0,1]\\subset C[0,1]$ the subspace containing the functions that are restrictions of polynomials. So we may have the functions $1$, $x$, $x^2$, $x^7+3x^3-15$, and so on. Well, we could as well think in the space of polynomials; the restriction to $[0,1]$ is purely formal, and that’s exactly the hot point! Let $T$ be the linear map defined asEven when dealing with functions over $[0,1]$ this map is well-defined because polynomials are uniquely extended. Is $T$ linear? Dead linear! But it is not continuous. Indeed, let $p_n(x)=\\dfrac{x^n}{2^n}$ and $p(x)=0$            Look! $p_n\\longrightarrow p$ since $d(p_n,p)=|p(1)-p_n(1)|=|0-\\frac{1}{2^n}|=\\frac{1}{2^n}$. Now $T(p_n)=p_n(2)=1$ for all $n$ and $T(p)=p(2)=0$! That’s certainly a discontinuity. But wait, there are discontinuities at every point! Given any polynomial $q$, we may consider $q+p_n\\longrightarrow q$. And of course one may replace $2$ with another value outside $[0,1]$ and voilà! As many discontinuous linear maps as we want.Perhaps we should have chosen another topology? You may try to change the metric and the topology, but you will always have this sort of problems, at least if we keep them compatible with the vector space structure (this compatibility will be defined later as the metric being a norm)Next shocking result: $P[0,1]\\subset C[0,1]$ is not a closed subspace. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, every vector subspace (planes, lines and points) are closed. No longer in infinite dimension! Let $f=e^x|_{[0,1]}\\in C[0,1]$. Due to the Taylor theorems, we know that the Taylor polynomialsuniformly converge to $f$ in $[0,1]$. That is: $p_n\\longrightarrow f$, hence $P[0,1]\\subset C[0,1]$ is not closed, since $f_n\\in P[0,1]\\,\\forall n$ and $f\\in C[0,1]\\smallsetminus P[0,1]$. Moreover, that reveals an intrinsic topological property of $P[0,1]$: it is not a complete space.Now surprisingly, all these problems are no real problems, but give rise to an extremely rich branch of Mathematics: Functional Analysis. The objects it deals with are mainly      Infinite dimension vector spaces topologized by compatible metrics (normed spaces)        especially those which become complete (Banach spaces)        and the continuous linear maps between them  ",
